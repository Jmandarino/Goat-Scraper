# GOAT Scaper
Website scraper for the website [www.goat.com](https://www.goat.com/) that searches for a specific used sneaker and returns the prices availible for it. 

## Proof of concept
This project was used for me to get familiar with Beautiful soup

## Input 

A link to the used sneaker is necessary eg: (https://www.goat.com/sneakers/yeezy-boost-350-pirate-2016-bb5350/used).

This current version prints out a list of all the prices low to high of all the Used pairs of the "yeezy 350 boost pirate black" in 10.5.
